This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A web application to create and track notes/tasks. The user's notes are stored in local storage, and then used to restore the state on a reload or upon openning the application again.

Markdown is supported in the note body (e.g. # will create a header in the note)

## Future Additions ##
- Edit button on individual notes
- Search bar
- Sort functionality
